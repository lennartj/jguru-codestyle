# About jGuru-codestyle-java-api-parent

The API parent should be used as the parent POM of all API (or SPI) artifact projects.
In addition to providing all facilities included in the `jGuru-codestyle-java-parent`, the 
`jGuru-codestyle-java-api-parent` generates a JAR manifest which contains export statements 
for all packages within the project. Such a manifest assists in accessing classes and 
resources from within the JAR if executing within a classloader-restricted runtime 
environment such as OSGi. 

## Module technologies vs configuration

All (or most) of the Module technology implementations require specific configuration to work properly.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Module Technology</th>
        <th>Handled by default</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>OSGi</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>Correct <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> attributes automatically generated by plugins configured 
        within the <code>jGuru-codestyle-java-api-parent</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Jigsaw / Java9 Modules</td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>The jDeps plugin </td>
    </tr>
</table> 

Moreover, the java-api-parent generates a module-info file 
compliant with Java 9 indicating that all packages/types defined in APIs should be public.
